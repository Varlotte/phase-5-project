## The Pitch:

Statistically, most doctors' appointments in this country last an average of 17.4 minutes.
In that time, patients are often prescribed medications with little time for dialogue with a provider about side effects, interactions, or even correct dosage information.
Enter RXGnosis: a tool that empowers patients to come to doctor's appointments with knowledge about commonly prescribed medications and their side effects for common mental health conditions.

## User Stories:

- Users will be able to create a secure RXGnosis account where their email and faved medications will be saved.
- From there, they'll be able to read up on four of the most common mental health diagnoses: depression, anxiety, ptsd, and adhd.
- Clicking into one of these conditions will take users to RXMatch for that condition.
- RX Match feature works just like Tinder, but for mental health care. Patients will be able to use the accessible interface to swipe through reliable information from a federal API about commonly prescribed medications for a treatment, view common side effects, and save the medications that look most relevant to their needs to bring to future doctors' appointments.
- Users will be able to show their faved meds list to providers in appointments to better advocate for their own care and be a more informed part of a greater healthcare conversation.
- Users can remove faves from their saved faves list in their account.
- Users can use the seach tool in the RXGNosis navbar to search for a medication by name (generic or brand name) regardless of whether or not they are logged in. If the user is logged in, they can also save medications to their account from this named search.

## Caveats:

1. This is not a diagnostic tool. There will be clear disclaimers on the site indicating that this tool is for people who already have their diagnosis from a professional. We'll also provide resources to our data sets and sources and recommend users not use WebMD.
2. Not all medications or treatment plans will be on here, especially off-label prescriptions. This won't be all-inclusive, and there will be disclaimers for that.
3. There will probably need to be a disclaimer here about HIPAA if this ever goes public.

## CRUD functionality:

- C- create user account, create a fave
- R- read account info, read medication info, read condition info, read my faves
- U- update account info
- D- delete account, delete a fave (aka unfave)
- full CRUD on user object, partial CRUD on faves

## API Contract:

tentative backend routing:
(note: curr_medications and curr_conditions are currently stretch goals )

- POST /users (create new user account)
- GET /users/<int:id> (read my account, also will be serialized to include reads for user's curr_meds, faves, and conditions)
- PATCH /users/<int:id> (update my account info, including name/email)
- DELETE /users/<int:id> (delete account)
- POST /faves (adds new fave to a medication)
- DELETE /faves/<int:id>faves (unfaves a medication)
- POST /users/<int:id>/curr_meds (adds a new current medication if user is taking or prescribed it)
- DELETE/users/<int:id>/curr_meds (removes a current medication if user is no longer taking or prescribed it)
- POST /users/<int:id>/conditions (adds a new diagnosis to reflect user's most accurate diagnoses)
- DELETE /users/<int:id>/conditions (removes a diagnosis to reflect user's most accurate diagnoses)
- GET /medications/<int:id> (read specific medication info)
- GET /medications (search for a medication by either brand or generic name)
- GET /conditions (read list of conditions)
- GET /conditions/<int:id> (read a specific condition and all meds associated with it for RXMatch)
- POST /login (login is a POST request)
- POST /logout (logout is a POST request)

## Data Models and Relationships:

(note: curr_medications and curr_conditions are currently stretch goals)

<img width="634" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-23 at 2 35 16 PM" src="https://github.com/Varlotte/phase-5-project/assets/32116877/4694f93a-e5a4-4191-8bc0-4e82ab19d1aa">

### Relationships:

(note: curr_medications and curr_conditions are currently stretch goals)

- A user can fave many medications
- A medication can be faved by many users
- A user has many current medications
- A medication can be currently used by many users
- A user can have many conditions
- A condition can affect many users
- A medication can treat many conditions
- A condition can be treated by many medications

## Validations:

- Name must be a string longer than 0 characters.
- Users must be older than 18.
- Password must be longer than 12 characters.
- Email must contain '@' symbol.

## Client-Side Routes:

- "/" homepage
- "/account" user account
- "/conditions" the list of conditions
- "/conditions/:id" shows the list of treatments for this condition (aka RXMatch)
- "/resources" a list of resources and sources used in the creation of the site
- "/signup" a signup page
- "/login" a login page
- "/logout" logs the user out
- "/medications?q={query}" displays the medications card(s) matching search criteria
- "/medications/id" displays the information for a specific medication (clickable from the faves list)

## Stretch Goals:

1. Adding users' current medications (curr_medication) and current diagnoses (curr_condition) back in, on both the backend and frontend, to allow users a greater range of functionality.
2. Showing drug interactions in RXMatch (either manually built or pulled in from the external API built by the National Library of medicine)
3. Letting users privately rate their experiences with their current medications.
4. Including commonly prescribed dosages for medications.
5. Including more than four conditions, and more than fifteen medications.
6. Tracking side effects privately.
7. Allowing users to leave private notes and ratings about providers.
8. Printable and mobile-friendly versions of the faved meds page.
9. Deploying this application.

## If Scaling Down is Necessary:

(note: As of 11/6/23, option 1 was executed.)

1. Remove the curr meds and user conditions tables tracking users' current treatment and conditions to instead prioritize developing RXMatch (faved medications.) (If this ends up being done, models used will be Medication, User, Condition, with Faved Med, and Treatment as intermediate tables.) Curr_meds and User Conditions can then be added back in as stretch goals.
2. Make RXMatch a list, not a Tinder-like UX swipe.

## External APIs:

(tentative, still reviewing which ones will be most useful)

- https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/drugsfda/ (FDA API containing most drug products approved since 1998. Huge data set, no public key needed, but might be hard to navigate.)
- https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/APIs/api-RxNorm.getDrugs.html (National Library of Medicine API- this one has an exhaustive list of drugs by brand name and generic)
- https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/RxNav/APIs/api-Interaction.findDrugInteractions.html (National Library of Medicine API- this is for tracking drug interactions, which is a stretch goal)
- https://www.goodrx.com/developer/documentation (GoodRX API, tracks names (both generic and brand) but is more focused on price than anything else and is a private company so less reliable.)

## Risks:

- Hopefully the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health/FDA APIs have everything I need for drug info.
- In the real world, this would take maneuvering for HIPAAA compatibility.
- There might be too many relationships for this stage of the project (see above for things I can cut.)

## How Work Is Tracked:

- <img width="1107" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-23 at 9 14 47 PM" src="https://github.com/Varlotte/phase-5-project/assets/32116877/722905b3-a2f6-4566-a7e8-213f5cc41c88">
- Using Linear.app, dividing work up into weeklong sprints with tickets linked to pull requests

## A Quick Note:

-If the python shell is having trouble with flask-restful and won't run the command "python server/app.py", try running it with "pipenv run python server/app.py"
